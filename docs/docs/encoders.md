# Rotary encoders

**Vial implements optional GUI configuration for rotary encoders.** This allows users to set up separate keycode actions for clockwise and counterclockwise encoder rotations. Encoders fully support QMK layers, so different keycodes can be used for different layers.

You will need to port your keyboard over to Vial before encoders are supported. Follow [Step 1](/porting-to-via.md) and [Step 2](/porting-to-vial.md) to get started.

In order to enable encoder support in your firmware, follow these steps:

## 1. Add basic QMK support for encoders

> Information
> {: .label .label-green }
> If you are working from an existing QMK firmware with working encoders, this step can likely be skipped

Add this to your main `keyboard.json`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "encoder": true
  }
}
```
or to your main `rules.mk`:

```make
ENCODER_ENABLE = yes
```

> Notice!
> {: .label .label-yellow }
> keyboard.json are not allowed inside the keymap folder by the compiler, so if you are adding encoders to a keyboard that doesn't have this in QMK, use `rules.mk` to keep all edits inside the keymap folder.

Configure the encoder pins in `keyboard.json`:

```json
{
  "encoder": {
    "rotary": [
      { "pin_a": "B0", "pin_b": "C14", "resolution": 4 },
      { "pin_a": "B1", "pin_b": "C15", "resolution": 4 }
    ]
  }
}
```

or in `config.h`: 

```c
//1 Encoder
#define ENCODERS_PAD { encoderA, encoderB }

//2 or more encoders
#define ENCODERS_PAD_A { encoder1a, encoder2a }
#define ENCODERS_PAD_B { encoder1b, encoder2b }
```
> Notice!
> {: .label .label-yellow }
> making edits in keyboard.json are generally depreciated, but again, keyboard.json are not allowed inside the keymap folder, so this applies only if editing without previous support in QMK.

Further advanced options follows QMK's rules for encoders, refer to [QMK documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_encoders?id=encoders) in order to configure encoders fully.

## 2. Enable QMK Encoder Map

Add this to the `rules.mk` file in the Vial keymap folder:

```make
ENCODER_MAP_ENABLE = yes
```

> Warning!
> {: .label .label-red }
> This rule should only be done at the keymap level, not at the keyboard level! Do NOT add this option to `keyboard.json`!

Add this to the `keymap.c` in the Vial keymap folder (example of two encoders, four layers):

```c
#if defined(ENCODER_MAP_ENABLE)
const uint16_t PROGMEM encoder_map[][NUM_ENCODERS][NUM_DIRECTIONS] = {
    [0] =   { ENCODER_CCW_CW(KC_MS_WH_UP, KC_MS_WH_DOWN), ENCODER_CCW_CW(KC_VOLD, KC_VOLU)  },
    [1] =   { ENCODER_CCW_CW(RGB_HUD, RGB_HUI),           ENCODER_CCW_CW(RGB_SAD, RGB_SAI)  },
    [2] =   { ENCODER_CCW_CW(RGB_VAD, RGB_VAI),           ENCODER_CCW_CW(RGB_SPD, RGB_SPI)  },
    [3] =   { ENCODER_CCW_CW(RGB_RMOD, RGB_MOD),          ENCODER_CCW_CW(KC_RIGHT, KC_LEFT) },
// layer                Encoder 1                                     Encoder 2
};
#endif
```
> Information
> {: .label .label-green }
> The encoder map needs to have the same number of layers as your main keymap.

> Notice!
> {: .label .label-yellow }
> In Vial, the layers are denoted by numbers only and cannot be named. If you are working from an existing QMK keymap with named layers, they need to be changed to reflect this. 

Refer to [QMK documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_encoders?id=encoder-map) for more details about the `ENCODER_MAP` feature.

### Notable differences in Vial from QMK
Encoder mapping ***replaces*** the older QMK style with encoder callbacks, which needs to be removed from the Vial `keymap.c` for your firmware to compile and work properly if it exists. They should, however, be left intact in the default keymap for backwards compatability with QMK. This code is legacy code and should over time be removed from QMK's and Vial's code base.

## 3. Add Vial encoders as part of KLE keymap

In the Vial JSON, an encoder is defined as either ***two or three*** 1u switches, with the labels representing the possible actions it can have (Clockwise/Counter Clockwise rotation). These lables are completely unique to the encoders, and are ***NOT*** part of the matrix.

**Not having both rotary switches defined makes the JSON invalid.**


**An encoder with no clickable button:**

![](../img/encoders-kle.png)

**An encoder with a clickable button:**

![](../img/encoders-kle2.png)

**Dual encoders with buttons:**

![](../img/dual-encoders-kle.png)

**Multiple encoders combined with matrix:**

Notice that in this example, the top row of switches marked red, are intended to be replaced by the encoders button action.

![](../img/multiple-encoders-kle.png)

### Encoder Legends
**Center legend**
- The two switches for the CW and CCW rotary actions both have a center legend of `e`.
 
**Top Legend**
- The top legend denotes the rotary index and action. **NOT the matrix position, or switch index.** This is separate from the matrix, and should not be confused with each other. `Encoder Index (0 ->), Rotary action (0 = CCW, 1 = CW)`
> If your board uses multiple encoders, the Encoder Index has to scale up by 1 for each encoder the board has so as to not conflict with other encoders, like so below:

![](../img/multi-encoders-kle.png)

**Clickable button**
- The bottom 1u switch represents the actual clickable button, and is usually part of the normal matrix, **having a normal index** of where it is placed in the matrix, **not related to the actual encoder**, this can also be shared with the normal key that it replaces physically.


### KLE import
Exporting the JSON from KLE will introduce the following lines to your file, these relate to the encoders (Example of two encoders):
```
  ["0,0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne",
  "0,1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne"],
  
  ["1,0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne",
  "1,1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne"],
```
Enclose any associated x w h with double quotes `"`, as the KLE JSON and vial JSON has slight differences in notation.

Compile and flash the firmware, and you should be able to configure encoders in the UI:
