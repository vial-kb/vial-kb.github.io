> `vial-qmk` provides several examples of most common microcontroller configurations set up for Vial usage. You can check them out at [`vial-qmk/keyboards/vial_example`](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk/tree/vial/keyboards/vial_example).

# Porting to Vial
> Information
> {: .label .label-green }
> If an already ported firmware exists, there is no need to redo the porting process. Just use the existing one! If your keyboard has a keymap folder named 'vial' it is already ported!
> [`vial-qmk/keyboards/`](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk/tree/vial/keyboards/)

The second part of this tutorial will guide you through porting your keyboard to Vial. **It assumes you will be adapting source code that was written for and known to work with a recent version of [QMK](https://qmk.fm/).** Keyboard designers are strongly suggested to create a `default` QMK keymap first to familiarize themselves with the firmware creation process and correct any errors.

**If you only have precompiled firmware, you will need to obtain the source code for it before proceeding.** [You have the right to ask the maker of your keyboard for this](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#ModifiedJustBinary). Reverse-engineering hardware or software is beyond the scope of this guide.


> Information
> {: .label .label-green }
> Compiling Vial firmwware requires some basic knowledge of how to use a command line environmentâ€”a bit more than just `qmk compile`. If you are unfamiliar with commands such as `cd` and `pwd`, please read through [this basic primer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#basic_built-in_terminal_commands) to learn the commands you'll need to know.

## 1. Prepare Your Build Environment

> Important
> {: .label .label-yellow }
> You will need a QMK environment in order to build firmware for Vial. This is not the same thing as QMK Toolbox. If you do not have this, you must first follow QMK's guide [here](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started).
> Existing QMK environments may need to be updated, but there is no need to uninstall or remove anything. You can simply move to the appropriate folder when compiling firmware for QMK or Vial-QMK.

### Step by step guide:
1. Clone the latest version of the repository from [https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk) into a new folder. This folder should be located outside of any existing QMK repository folders. **Nesting `vial-qmk` inside `qmk_firmware` will cause issues, avoid this!**
   - If you are unfamiliar with git, and want a GUI version, install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) version for your OS. Go to [https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk) and select "Open in Github Desktop". Follow the guided download/cloning.
   - **Reference Guide:** Run `git clone https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk`.

2. Install the prerequisites for compilation.
  - Open the QMK command line environment and navigate to your new `vial-qmk` folder to run the above command. Refer to [this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#basic_built-in_terminal_commands) on how-to. In the image below, notice how it says 'vial-qmk' at the end of the prompt. This is your confirmation you have found the correct directory.
   - **Reference Guide:** Run `make git-submodule` in your new `vial-qmk` directory to clone the git submodules.

![](../img/beginner_prompt.png)

3. Verify that your installation is complete by running `qmk doctor`.
   - If you have added a new keyboard folder as part of your port, you will see `Git has unstashed/uncommitted changes.` Other than that, the only warning should be `The official repository does not seem to be configured as git remote "upstream".` (This is fine because Vial-QMK is not the official QMK repository.)
4. Test that your Vial-QMK installation is valid and working by compiling the `default` keymap for an **existing keyboard** that ideally is available in both qmk and qmk-vial repositories.
   - Run `make path/to/keyboard:default` in the `vial-qmk` directory. Note that the path does *not* include the folder `vial-qmk/keyboards/` nor does it have a leading slash. It should start with the name of the keyboard or designer, e.g. `make vial_example/vial_atmega32u4:default`
   - If the existing keyboard do not build using their `default` keymap, nothing else based on your newly installed repository will either!
5. Test that the `default` keymap for **your** keyboard builds in qmk-vial.
   - Depending on version changes between QMK and Vial, inconsistencies may occur [based on the version of QMK it was created for](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/breaking_changes?id=what-has-been-included-in-past-breaking-changes).
   - Code copy-and-pasted in from other repositories (not inheited from QMK main repository) may be made for older versions of QMK and will then need to be modified to the current version **before** attempting to port them to Vial. 

> Important
> {: .label .label-yellow }
> Running `make` is not quite the same as running `qmk compile`. Running `qmk compile` in the wrong directory will default to compiling QMK firmware, not Vial firmware. To avoid any potential confusion, always use `make`. (This is especially important to verify before seeking help!)


## 2. Create a new `vial` keymap

Copy the existing `keymaps/default` folder to `keymaps/vial` with the content intact. Leave the `keymaps/default` folder in place; do not modify or remove it.

> Warning!
> {: .label .label-yellow }
> When porting to Vial, the resulting keymap should ALWAYS be named `vial` and nothing else! This avoids any confusion about if the keyboard has already been ported or not.

You may obviously name your personal keymaps in whatever fashion you prefer, but to be accepted into the main Vial git and distributed to other users, _only_ keymaps named `vial` is allowed.

## 3. Enable Vial in your rules file

Create a new file (or edit an existing one) under `[keyboard_name]/keymaps/vial/rules.mk` with the following contents:<sup>[(example)](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk/blob/90f3b0e2e188eccb23ed8a2a690df278a0f1057b/keyboards/vial_example/vial_atmega32u4/keymaps/vial/rules.mk#L2)</sup>

```
VIA_ENABLE = yes
VIAL_ENABLE = yes
```
> Important
> {: .label .label-yellow }
> Both of these rules are required to be in the keymap `rules.mk`. Do not remove `VIA_ENABLE` as it causes the compile to fail silently! 

> Warning!
> {: .label .label-red }
> Do NOT include either `VIA_ENABLE` or `VIAL_ENABLE` on a keyboard level `rules.mk`, the structure in layers allows the code in the `keyboards` folder to be backwards compatible with QMK.

Making changes outside the **vial keymap** folder is strongly discouraged, and any code doing so will **not** be accepted in the main Vial git!

If you find outright errors in code in a keyboard, or the keyboards needs to be updated to current version, those changes should be made at QMK level, and then inherited back to Vial, not the other way around, as that breaks the chain of compatability.

## 4. Move JSON so Vial can find it

Place your keyboard definition JSON (either one made in step 1 of this tutorial or downloaded from the [VIA keyboards repository](https://github.com/the-via/keyboards/tree/master/src)) under `[keyboard_name]/keymaps/vial/vial.json` so that Vial build process can find it. <sup>[(example)](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk/blob/90f3b0e2e188eccb23ed8a2a690df278a0f1057b/keyboards/vial_example/vial_atmega32u4/keymaps/vial/vial.json)</sup>

> Important
> {: .label .label-yellow }
> This file must be named `vial.json`. It cannot have any other name to be valid in compile.

> Warning!
> {: .label .label-red }
> The Vial keyboard definition (`vial.json`) is not the same as an `info.json` file. You cannot copy an `info.json` file to use as the `vial.json`.

## 5. Generate and add unique keyboard ID
The ID generated is unique for the firmware to a keyboard type and model; it does not need to be unique for each individual keyboard or firmware compiled.

From the root of vial-qmk, run `python3 util/vial_generate_keyboard_uid.py` in order to generate a unique Vial keyboard ID:

```
python3 util/vial_generate_keyboard_uid.py
#define VIAL_KEYBOARD_UID {0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX}
```

Create a new file under `[keyboard_name]/keymaps/vial/config.h` and add the following contents to it:

```
/* SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later */

#pragma once

#define VIAL_KEYBOARD_UID {0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX, 0xXX}
```

The last line should match what you got in the previous step. <sup>[(example)](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk/blob/90f3b0e2e188eccb23ed8a2a690df278a0f1057b/keyboards/vial_example/vial_atmega32u4/keymaps/vial/config.h#L5)</sup>

## 6. Set up a secure unlock combination

Vial needs a key combination in order to protect the user from a malicious host computer unknowingly changing security-sensitive settings, such as flashing a malicious firmware; for more information see [here](security.md).

If you do not want to utilize this feature, you should set `VIAL_INSECURE = yes` in your `keymaps/vial/rules.mk`. While you can distribute the resulting firmware to your users and will not lose any Vial functionality, note that keyboards which enable `VIAL_INSECURE` will not be accepted to the main `vial-qmk` repository.

For keyboards that do not define `VIAL_INSECURE`, proceed to configure `VIAL_UNLOCK_COMBO_ROWS` and `VIAL_UNLOCK_COMBO_COLS` definitions:

* You should configure a combo of at least 2 keys
* Suppose this is your KLE and you want to configure a combo of Escape+Enter:

![](../img/security-kle.png)

* The Escape key is located at [0, 0] and the Enter key is at [2, 13]
* So you should set in your `keymaps/vial/config.h` right below the `VIAL_KEYBOARD_UID` line <sup>[(example)](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk/blob/90f3b0e2e188eccb23ed8a2a690df278a0f1057b/keyboards/vial_example/vial_atmega32u4/keymaps/vial/config.h#L6-L7)</sup>:
  * `#define VIAL_UNLOCK_COMBO_ROWS { 0, 2 }`
  * `#define VIAL_UNLOCK_COMBO_COLS { 0, 13 }`
* Note that this feature works with multi-layout keyboards, however you should make sure that the keys you pick appear in every possible layout:
![](../img/security-user-prompt.png)

After you flash the firmware, check that the function works correctly by activating the "Security->Unlock" menu.

## 7. Compile Vial firmware for your keyboard

Compiling and flashing can be done in the same way as QMK. For example, to compile a `vial` keymap for a keyboard located under `keyboards/xyz/xyz60`, run `make xyz/xyz60:vial` from the root `vial-qmk` directory. If at this point you're having issues making the firmware fit (running out of flash, RAM or EEPROM), see [this guide](firmware-size.md) for how to reduce Vial firmware size.

## Done!

You now should be able to compile the firmware, flash it, and have your keyboard auto-detected by Vial.
