# Select Vial GUI features

**By default Vial enables all GUI features when you create/compile a firmware for a keyboard.** This takes up a fair bit of resources, and depending on your controller/MCU, it can be a good idea to be a bit more selective in which functionality is the most important to the particular keyboard you are compiling for. 

Depending on the type of keyboard (full-size/split/macropad etc), some options simply aren't that useful, and others may be entirely neccesary for it to function as intended.

This also means that some older designs with less powerful MCU's like the classic AVR line in the popular Pro Micro controllers may need to disable or reduce the amount of slots configured in some features to make the firmware fit.

# Available GUI features

## QMK Settings

QMK Settings allows you to configure settings for all the other GUI features, like Tapping term/Permissive hold/Tapping delay for Tap Dance, and Mouse key timing, Auto shift behaviour etc. 

Without it, you are missing out on a lot of Vial's actual functionality.

### Configure memory usage

To turn off this feature and reduce compiled firmware size, add the following line to your `keymaps/vial/rules.mk`:

```
QMK_SETTINGS = no
```

## Dynamic Tap Dance

Dynamic Tap Dance is the GUI equivalent to [QMK's Tap Dance](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_tap_dance) and can do pretty much what it does, with minor differences as you assign it in GUI rather than code.

Tap the comma key, and you get a comma. Tap it twice and you get a semicolon. Tap it thrice, and you can select entirely what to output.

### Configure memory usage

By default, Tap dance is configured to have 8 slots. To reduce RAM and EEPROM usage, you can define the following in your `config.h`: 

```
#define VIAL_TAP_DANCE_ENTRIES 4
```

To turn off this feature completely, and also reducing compiled firmware size, add the following line to your `keymaps/vial/rules.mk`:

```
TAP_DANCE_ENABLE = no
```

## Dynamic Combos
Dynamic Combos are the GUI equivalent to [QMK's Combos](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_combo?id=combos) and is a chording solution for adding custom actions. It lets you hit multiple keys at once and produce a different effect. For instance, hitting A and B within the combo term would hit ESC instead, or have it perform even more complex tasks, all configurable in the GUI.

### Configure memory usage

By default, Combos is configured to have 8 slots. To reduce RAM and EEPROM usage, you can define the following in your `config.h`: 

```
#define VIAL_COMBO_ENTRIES 4
```

To turn off this feature completely, and also reducing compiled firmware size, add the following line to your `keymaps/vial/rules.mk`:

```
COMBO_ENABLE = no
```

## Dynamic Key Overrides
Dynamic Key overrides is the GUI equivalent to [QMK's Key Overrides](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_key_overrides) and allows you to override modifier-key combinations to send a different modifier-key combination or perform completely custom actions. 

Donâ€™t want shift + 1 to type ! on your computer? Use a key override to make your keyboard type something different when you press shift + 1. The general behavior is like this: If modifiers w + key x are pressed, replace these keys with modifiers y + key z in the keyboard report.

### Configure memory usage

By default, Key override is configured to have 8 slots. To reduce RAM and EEPROM usage, you can define the following in your `config.h`: 

```
#define VIAL_KEY_OVERRIDE_ENTRIES 4
```

To turn off this feature completely, and also reducing compiled firmware size, add the following line to your `keymaps/vial/rules.mk`:

```
KEY_OVERRIDE_ENABLE = no
```

## Dynamic Macros 

Dynamic Macro's is Vials answer to both [QMK Macros](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_macros) and [Dynamic Macro's](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_dynamic_macros) as it allows both functionality to be configured in GUI.

Macro's are basically the most powerful tool, and when all else fails, use one to bend your keyboard to your will.

### Configure memory usage

By default, 16 macros can be configured in Vial. To reduce RAM and EEPROM usage, you can define the following in your `config.h`: 

```
#define DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_COUNT 4
```

To turn off this feature completely, and also reducing compiled firmware size, add the following line to your `keymaps/vial/rules.mk`:

```
KEY_OVERRIDE_ENABLE = no
```

# Reducing firmware size

By default Vial enables every supported feature. As a result, on low-powered chips such as AVR series you might experience running out of flash memory, RAM, or EEPROM.

```
quantum/dynamic_keymap.c:102:1: error: static assertion failed: "Dynamic keymaps are configured to use more EEPROM than is available."
_Static_assert(DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_EEPROM_MAX_ADDR >= DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_EEPROM_ADDR + 100, "Dynamic keymaps are configured to use more EEPROM than is available.");
```

```
 * The firmware is too large! 30768/28672 (2096 bytes over)
 [ERRORS]

make[1]: *** [tmk_core/rules.mk:469: check-size] Error 1
make: *** [Makefile:530: yd60mq:vial] Error 1
Make finished with errors
```

If that happens to your keyboard, you can try utilizing of the options below to make the firmware fit.

### Enable LTO

To enable LTO, add the following line to your `keymaps/vial/rules.mk`:

```
LTO_ENABLE = yes
```

LTO makes the compiler work harder when optimizing your code, resulting in a smaller firmware size.

> Information
> {: .label .label-green }
> Using LTO can in rare situations expose buggy code in a way which could break certain firmware functionality. Make sure to test your keyboard firmware throughly after enabling this option.

### Reducing dynamic keymap layers

By default Vial is configed to have 4 keymap layers, To reduce EEPROM usage, you can define the following in your `config.h` file:

```
#define DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_LAYER_COUNT 2
```



## Using a different bootloader

```
 * The firmware is too large! 30768/28672 (2096 bytes over)
 [ERRORS]

make[1]: *** [tmk_core/rules.mk:469: check-size] Error 1
make: *** [Makefile:530: yd60mq:vial] Error 1
Make finished with errors
```

**If you have already done all of the above, and you still see this message trying to compile your firmware on an AVR such as the popular Atmega32u4 (used on Pro Micro), it might be time to break out of the mould a little.** 

Almost all of these controllers are delivered with the Caterina bootloader, and while this bootloader is very stable and plain **just works!** in all situtations, it's also fairly old code and quite large, using ~3500 bytes of your codespace. Most of it for features you will never really use.

Changing your bootloader to a more modern, more slim-lined one that does exactly what is needed and nothing else, can save you a whole lot of codespace for your keymap and functions.

### Potential drawbacks
**Changing the bootloader makes your firmware somewhat 'non-standard'**, so sharing them means the other user also have to swap to your preffered bootloader. It also requires you to use an ISP programmer (or another arduino) to flash the controller with the bootloader once, before it can be used as normal flashing the code over USB. (This is very similar to recovering the bootloader in the event of a bricked Pro Micro).

### What do I gain?
Codespace, glorious codespace!

### What bootloader is recommended?
There are several that should work and reduce the size to various amounts, some adding functions you might like, some being slimmed down. 
* [LUFA-DFU](https://github.com/abcminiuser/lufa) is a popular one that is slightly smaller than Caterina, and adds features (size depends on what features you enable).
* [QMK-DFU](https://github.com/qmk/lufa) is a fork maintained by the QMK team and also adds features.
* [nanoBoot](https://github.com/osamuaoki/nanoBoot) is a _tiny_ 512 bytes HID bootloader, that does exactly _one_ thing, allowing you to hold reset on plug-in, and enter the bootloader/flashing, in the exact same way as Caterina does.
